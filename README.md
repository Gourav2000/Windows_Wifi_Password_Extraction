# Windows_Wifi_Password_Extraction
Just Like the title the title sounds.It extracts all the wifi nteworks you have logged into with your pc and reveals it. I made it, cause i was learning the subprocesses module of 
python and thought it would be a preety fun experiment to test my understanding. It will be particularly helpful in cases you forgot your wifi password. And you may also use it for
plenty of other stuffs(Like tricking your freind into revealing his/her wifi password, Don't worry I am not judging lol!).

Using it is preety simple either run the ExtractionScript.py in your cmd,terminal or wherever you run your python programs. The output will reveal all the necessary details

```shell
python ExtractionScript.py.py
```
or

```shell
python3 ExtractionScript.py.py
```
depends on your OS.

In case you just want to test the script out and ignore the boring details...you can the download the exe file from below and test it out.

## Exe file
You can test it out directly by downloading the exe file from here https://github.com/Gourav2000/Windows_Wifi_Password_Extraction/raw/master/dist/ExtractionScript.exe 
and it's not harmful for your device by the way lol!
