# Windows_Wifi_Password_Extraction
Just Like the title sounds.It extracts all the password of the wifi networks you have logged into with your pc till date and reveals it. I made it, cause i was learning the subprocess module of python and thought it would be a preety fun experiment to test my understanding. It will be particularly helpful in case you forgot your wifi password, you may also use it for plenty of other stuffs(Like tricking your freind into revealing his/her wifi password, Don't worry I am not judging lol!).

Using it is preety simple either run the ExtractionScript.py in your cmd,terminal or wherever you run your python programs or use the exe. The output will reveal all the necessary details

```shell
python ExtractionScript.py
```
or

```shell
python3 ExtractionScript.py
```
depends on your OS.

In case you haven't worked with python before or just want to test the script out and ignore the boring details...you can the download the exe file from below and test it out.

## Exe file
You can test it out directly by downloading the exe file from here https://github.com/Gourav2000/Windows_Wifi_Password_Extraction/raw/master/dist/ExtractionScript.exe 
and even if chrome shows you a warning, it's not harmful for your device in anyway lol!
